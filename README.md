Diabetes foot complications - risk prediction model

## Introduction

This repository contains model objects, dummy data, and R code allowing users to generate predictions for the risk prediction models reported by Roberts & Loeffler et al. (in preparation). Briefly, the paper reports two models predicting the risk of diabetic foot complications in hospitalized patients with diabetes diagnosis who are discharged from General Internal Medicine (GIM):

1) Fine-Gray Regression (FGR)
2) Random Survival Forest for Competing Risk (RSF-CR)
